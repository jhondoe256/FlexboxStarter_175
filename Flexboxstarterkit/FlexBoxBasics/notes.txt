Flexbox -> one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows and columns

with this we can distribute space dynamically across elements of an unknown size

Flex-direction allows us to change the flex-direction of elements

default: flex-direction: row  (left to right)
flex-direction: row-reverse   (right to left)

            ^
            |
            |    (defalult) flex-direction: row
            |
            |
<-------------------------------> (main axis(x))
            |
            |
            |
            |  (cross axis(y)
            |
            V



            ^
            |
            |     flex-direction: column
            |    (cross axis(x))
            |
<-------------------------------> 
            |
            |
            |(main axis(y))           
            |
            V

flex-direction: column (main axis is top to bottom)
flex-direction: columb-reverse (main axis will go bottom to top)


justify-content: flex-start -> how content is distributed across the main axis (not always on the left side)

3 froms of flex-wrap,
flex-wrap: wrap ,nowrap, flex-reverse
